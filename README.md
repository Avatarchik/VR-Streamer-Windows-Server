# VR-Streamer-Windows-Server
Windows Server for VR Streamer Server iOS App

Official web site: [www.gagagu.de](http://www.gagagu.de)

With my VR-Streamer server, the GVRS opentrack plugin, my VR Streamer iOS app and correspronding vr googles you can simply dive into virtual reality. 
The VR-Streamer server serves you the possibillity to stream the image output of windows games (only in windowed mode) 
to your iphone. At the same time tracking data can be tranfered from iphone via UDP network connection to a 
head tracking application (like Opentack with my special gvrs plugin https://github.com/gagagu/ftnoir_tracker_gvrs). Read for more informations on the official site.
